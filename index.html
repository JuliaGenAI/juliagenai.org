The organization is not intended to usurp robust tools like <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml">ggml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">ollama</a>, etc.</p> <p>Rather, JuliaGenAI is intended to provide a platform for furthering access to these tools in Julia, as well as to motivate the development of new tools and libraries for generative AI.</p> <p>You can see which language models tend to perform best on Julia code generation <a href="https://siml.earth/Julia-LLM-Leaderboard/stable/">here</a>.</p> <h2 id=organization_packages ><a href="#organization_packages" class=header-anchor >Organization packages</a></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaGenAI/HuggingFaceDatasets.jl">HuggingFaceDatasets.jl</a> that wraps the python <code>datasets</code> package from huggingface. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/CarloLucibello">Carlo Lucibello</a> for the package&#33; </p> </ul> <h2 id=related_packages ><a href="#related_packages" class=header-anchor >Related packages</a></h2> <p>JuliaGenAI is a new organization, and as such, it is still in the process of developing its first packages. However, we have several packages that represent the type of work we hope to promote. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/svilupp/awesome-generative-ai-meets-julia-language">Awesome List for GenAI meets Julia Language</a>.</p> <h3 id=interfaces_to_existing_tools ><a href="#interfaces_to_existing_tools" class=header-anchor >Interfaces to existing tools</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/svilupp/PromptingTools.jl">PromptingTools.jl</a>. Streamline your life using PromptingTools.jl, the Julia package that simplifies interacting with large language models.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/svilupp/LLMTextAnalysis.jl">LLMTextAnalysis.jl</a>. Effortlessly uncover and label thematic insights in large document collections using the power of Large Language Models and Julia Language.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaML/OpenAI.jl">OpenAI.jl</a>. A community-maintained Julia wrapper to the OpenAI API.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/chengchingwen/BytePairEncoding.jl">BytePairEncoding.jl</a>. Pure Julia implementation of Byte Pair Encoding &#40;BPE&#41; algorithm. It&#39;s used by Transformers.jl to tokenize text.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/marcom/Llama.jl/">Llama.jl</a>. Julia interface to llama.cpp, a C/C&#43;&#43; library for running language models locally. Supports a wide range of models.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/svilupp/AIHelpMe.jl">AIHelpMe.jl</a>. AIHelpMe harnesses the power of Julia&#39;s extensive documentation and advanced AI models to provide tailored coding guidance. By integrating with PromptingTools.jl, it offers a unique, AI-assisted approach to answering your coding queries directly in Julia&#39;s environment.</p> </ul> <h3 id=model_training_and_inference ><a href="#model_training_and_inference" class=header-anchor >Model training and inference</a></h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl">Lux.jl</a>. A purely functional deep learning framework for Julia, in the spirit of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jax</a>. Lux supports <a href="https://lux.csail.mit.edu/dev/api/Lux/layers">many predefined layers</a>, including attention layers through <a href="https://lux.csail.mit.edu/dev/api/Domain_Specific_Modeling/Boltz">Boltz</a>.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl">Flux.jl</a>. Flux is the most popular deep learning library for Julia. It is performant, flexible and allows the building of complex models. However, at the time of writing, We&#39;re not aware of any Large Language Models &#40;LLMs&#41; that have been trained in Flux. Flux is to Lux what pytorch is to Jax, in particular stateful vs stateless, although the two julia libraries share very similar interfaces.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/cafaxo/Llama2.jl">Llama2.jl</a>. Llama2.jl provides simple code for inference and training of llama2-based language models based on <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c">llama2.c</a>. It supports loading quantized weights in GGUF format &#40;<code>q4_K_S</code> variant&#41;. Training is only experimental at this stage.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/chengchingwen/Transformers.jl">Transformers.jl</a>. Transformers.jl is a Julia package built on to top of Flux.jl that provides a high-level API for using pre-trained transformer models. It also allows to download any model from the Hugging Face hub with <code>@hgf_str</code> macro string.</p> </ul> <h2 id=why_julia ><a href="#why_julia" class=header-anchor >Why Julia?</a></h2> <p>Julia is a fantastic tool for generative AI, for several reasons.</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Expressiveness</strong>. Julia is a high-level language with a powerful syntax that is token-cheap â€“ that is, you get a lot of &quot;program&quot; per token. It&#39;s not unlikely that AI agents will be writing code on their own in a lightly monitored way, and Julia&#39;s syntax is well-suited to low-cost AI code generation.</p> <li><p><strong>Interactiveness</strong>. Julia is a just-in-time compiled language, which means that it&#39;s fast to run, but also fast to develop in. This is important for AI development, where the ability to quickly prototype and test ideas is crucial. It has first-in-class REPL &#40;read-eval-print loop&#41; support, which could potentially be very important for rapid prototype development.</p> <li><p><strong>Performance</strong>. Julia is fast. Nuff&#39; said.</p> <li><p><strong>Community</strong>. Julia has a fantastic community, and it&#39;s growing. This is important for the development of AI tools, as it means that there are more people to help develop and maintain the tools that we need.</p> <li><p><strong>Ecosystem</strong>. Julia has a fantastic and growing ecosystem built by a wonderful community of developers.</p> </ol> <h2 id=how_to_contribute ><a href="#how_to_contribute" class=header-anchor >How to contribute</a></h2> <p>We are always looking for new contributors.
