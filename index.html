A modern deep learning framework for Julia, intended for training large models. It is a modern approach to Flux.jl, and will eventually superced Flux. Lux supports <a href="https://lux.csail.mit.edu/dev/api/Lux/layers">many predefined layers</a>, including attention layers through <a href="https://lux.csail.mit.edu/dev/api/Domain_Specific_Modeling/Boltz">Boltz</a>.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl">Flux.jl</a>. Flux is a machine learning library for Julia that is flexible and allows building complex models. However, at the time of writing, I&#39;m not aware of any Large Language Models &#40;LLMs&#41; that have been implemented and trained in Flux.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/cafaxo/Llama2.jl">Llama2.jl</a>. Llama2.jl provides simple code for inference and training of llama2-based language models based on <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c">llama2.c</a>. It supports loading quantized weights in GGUF format &#40;<code>q4_K_S</code> variant&#41;.

Transformers.jl is a Julia package that provides a high-level API for using pre-trained transformer models. It also allows to download any models from Hugging Face hub with <code>@hgf_str</code> macro string.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl">GraphNeuralNetworks.jl</a>. GraphNeuralNetworks.jl is a Julia package for graph neural networks. It is a high-level API for using pre-trained graph neural network models.</p> </ul> <h2 id=why_julia ><a href="#why_julia" class=header-anchor >Why Julia?</a></h2> <p>Julia is a fantastic tool for generative AI, for several reasons.</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Expressiveness</strong>. Julia is a high-level language with a powerful syntax that is token-cheap – that is, you get a lot of &quot;program&quot; per token. It&#39;s not unlikely that AI agents will be writing code on their own in a lightly-monitored way, and Julia&#39;s syntax is well-suited to low-cost AI code generation.</p> <li><p><strong>Interactiveness</strong>. Julia is a just-in-time compiled language, which means that it&#39;s fast to run, but also fast to develop in. This is important for AI development, where the ability to quickly prototype and test ideas is crucial. It has first-in-class REPL &#40;read-eval-print loop&#41; support, which could potentially be very important for rapid prototype development.</p> <li><p><strong>Performance</strong>. Julia is fast. Nuff&#39; said.</p> <li><p><strong>Community</strong>. Julia has a fantastic community, and it&#39;s growing. This is important for the development of AI tools, as it means that there are more people to help develop and maintain the tools that we need.</p> <li><p><strong>Ecosystem</strong>. Julia has a fantastic and growing ecosystem built by a wonderful community of developers.</p> </ol> <h2 id=how_to_contribute ><a href="#how_to_contribute" class=header-anchor >How to contribute</a></h2> <p>We are always looking for new contributors.
